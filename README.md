ConvertApp is a simple and user-friendly iOS application built with SwiftUI that allows users to perform various unit conversions with ease. The app provides individual sections for each conversion type, ensuring a clean and intuitive interface.

# Features

# Interactive UI

Each conversion has its own dedicated section with an input field, conversion button, and real-time output. Scrollable interface for easy navigation between different conversions.

# How to Use

Open the app on your iOS device. Scroll to the desired conversion section (e.g., "Fahrenheit to Celsius"). Enter the value you want to convert in the input field. View the converted value displayed below the input. Repeat for other conversions as needed.

# Technologies Used

**SwiftUI**: For building the user interface.

**State Management**: SwiftUI's @State property wrapper is used to handle real-time updates to user input and converted values.

**Reusable Components**: Custom ConversionSection component for clean and modular code design.
